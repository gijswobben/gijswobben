# Gijs Wobben
__*I love innovation*__, and I've been studying and practicing it for a long time now. Creating new ideas and leading brainstorm sessions, working with interdisciplinary teams on prototypes and MVPs, and creating strategic documents and plans to steer innovation so it supports the companies vision and long term goals. Every time it's amazing to see a vision of what the future should look like, turn into real products and services that help customers.

Data is at the core of almost any modern innovation. From Facebook to cars and high tech robots, they would not exist without large quantities and varieties of data. In my work as a __*Data Scientist*__ I make sense of this “Big Data” and come up with small or large innovations and business propositions, that make organizations data driven. I team up with Software developers and domain experts and capture their knowledge and understanding in models and business logic.
